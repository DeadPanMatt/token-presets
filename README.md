# Token Presets

Create multiple presets to speed up your actor / token creation.

If you've ever found yourself opening Token Config five times every time
you drop a new monster to set the same things - display name on hover,
disposition to hostile, link off - this module is for you.

---

## What you can save in a preset

Each preset can set any combination of:

- Display Name and Display Bars (when names and HP bars show)
- Disposition (Hostile, Neutral, Friendly, Secret)
- Link to actor data
- Lock rotation
- Scale, opacity, rotation
- Mirror horizontally / vertically
- Tint colour
- Dynamic Token Ring - enable on / off, ring and background colours,
  any combination of ring effects (Ring Pulse, Ring Gradient,
  Background Wave, Spectral Pulse, Color Over Subject), and a
  subject-scale slider

You can make as many presets as you like.

## Installing the module

1. In Foundry, open **Add-on Modules** → **Install Module**.
2. Paste this link into the box at the bottom:

   ```
   https://raw.githubusercontent.com/DeadPanMatt/token-presets/main/module.json
   ```

3. Click **Install**.
4. In your world, go to **Game Settings → Manage Modules**, tick
   **Token Presets**, and save.

You're ready.

## Making a preset

1. Go to **Game Settings → Configure Settings**.
2. Find **Token Presets** in the list and click **Manage Presets**.
3. Click **+ New Preset** at the bottom.
4. Give it a name (like *Hostile Monster*) and set the values you want.
5. Click **Save**.

**Or**

1. Under **Token Controls** Click on the user / Gear icon.
2. Click **Manage / create Presets**.
3. Click **+ New Preset**
4. Give it a name (like *Hostile Monster*) and set the values you want.
5. Click **Save**.

That's it. Your preset is ready to use (read on below for tips).

## Using a preset when creating a new actor

When you click **Create Actor** in the sidebar, a small **Token Preset**
dialog pops up. Pick the preset you want, click **Apply**, then fill
in the name and type as normal. The actor is now tagged with that preset,
and every time you drop it onto a scene the preset values are applied
automatically.

If you don't want to use a preset for a particular actor, pick
**- None -** instead. You can always tag the actor with a preset
later via right-click in the sidebar, or via the **Tag Actors with
a Preset** form in the Token Presets hub - see the next section.

---

## Using a preset on actors you already have

Right-click any actor in the sidebar and you'll see **Set Token
Preset…** in the menu. Pick a preset, click Apply, and that actor is now
tagged. Future tokens from that actor will use the preset.

To do a whole folder of actors at once, right-click the folder and pick
**Set Token Preset for All Actors…** - same picker, but it tags every
actor in the folder (and any sub-folders) in one go. It asks for
confirmation first so you know how many actors will be affected.

**Or**, to tag many actors at once across folders, via the Token
Presets hub:

1. Under **Token Controls** click on the user / Gear icon.
2. Click **Tag Actors with a Preset**.
3. *(Optional)* Click a folder in the left tree to narrow the list,
   or type in the search box to filter by name.
4. Click an actor to select. Ctrl-click for multi-select; Shift-click
   for a range; Ctrl+A for everything visible.
5. Pick a preset from the dropdown at the top.
6. Click **Apply** - every selected actor is tagged in one go.

---

## Using a preset on tokens already on the scene

Three ways, depending on what you want to update.

**Just these tokens, right now**, via the Token Presets hub:

1. Under **Token Controls** click on the user / Gear icon.
2. Click **Apply Preset to Canvas Tokens**.
3. *(Optional)* Use the filter buttons on the left (Disposition /
   Link State / Visibility) and/or the search box to narrow the
   list of tokens.
4. Tick the tokens you want. Anything you already had selected on
   the canvas is pre-ticked, so "select first, then click" still
   works.
5. Pick a preset from the dropdown at the top.
6. Click **Apply**.

**Every token of one actor.** Right-click the actor in the sidebar and
choose **Apply Preset to Placed Tokens**. This finds every copy of that
actor across all your scenes and updates them. (Only shows up if the
actor has a preset assigned.)

**Every token of every actor in a folder.** Right-click the folder and
choose **Apply Preset to Placed Tokens (Folder)**. Same idea, but
sweeping through everything in the folder at once.

All three ask for confirmation first and show you how many tokens are
about to change.

## "Foundry Default" - your reset button

Tucked at the top of the preset manager is a section called **View
Foundry Defaults**. Click to expand it. Inside is a read-only preset
that represents Foundry's vanilla token values - the default look of a
token straight out of the box.

You can't edit it, but you can:

- **Pick it from the picker** anywhere a preset is being chosen, to
  apply Foundry's defaults explicitly.
- **Pick *- None -* from the canvas toolbar surface** - it has the same
  effect, reverting selected tokens to vanilla values.
- **Reset a preset to it.** Each of your custom presets has a small
  **circular arrow** icon next to its name. Click it to overwrite that
  preset with Foundry's defaults - handy when you've made a mess and
  want to start over from a known-good baseline. Asks before
  overwriting.

---

## A few useful tips

- **Sections fold up.** Each preset has Identity, Appearance, and
  Dynamic Token Ring sections. Click a section header to collapse it
  if it's in the way.
- **A preset applies *every* setting it has.** There's no "leave this
  alone" option - when you apply a preset, all of its values get written
  to the token. So if you want a preset that only changes disposition,
  make sure the other values are also what you'd want (I recommend
  applying Foundry's defaults first).
- **Make presets per actor type.** Most people end up with a few
  templates: one for monsters, one for friendly NPCs, one for the
  party. Pick the right one when you create the actor and you've saved
  yourself a lot of clicking.

---

## Future plans

- **Vision.** Add Vision controls (Basic, Detection, and Advanced) to
  the preset menu.

## Found a bug? Have an idea?

Open an issue at
[github.com/DeadPanMatt/token-presets/issues][issues] and let me know
what happened. The more detail the better - what you were trying to do,
what you saw instead, your Foundry version, and your game system
(although that shouldn't really matter).
